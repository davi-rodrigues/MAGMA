This folder should contain any data tables with global parameters of each galaxy. This folder is only used by MAGMAtable . Each of the files can have any name. In each of their lines there should be data for one galaxy. The galaxy name in these files must match the galaxy name present in the files *_rotmod.dat (at the data-galaxies folder).
