This folder should contain one file for each of the galaxies to be analysed. 
The three galaxies present in this folder have fictitious names, they are here only to illustrate. 

Each file should start with the name of the galaxy and a "_rotmod.dat" should be appended to it.

The “_rotmod.dat” is the same ending used by the SPARC data sample. The SPARC data can be downloaded from 
http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/Rotmod_LTG.zip . 

If the SPARC data is used, please see further instructions for crediting it at http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/ .
