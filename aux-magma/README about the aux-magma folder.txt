This folder should contain two packages necessary for running MAGMAplots, whose main files are ELPlot.m and CustomTicks.m .

ELPlot is a small package made by myself, so I put it here. The provided version of ELPlot should be seen as part of MAGMA.

CustomTicks.m is not part of MAGMA and can be downloaded from https://github.com/mark-caprio/CustomTicks . Tested with version 2.1.0.
